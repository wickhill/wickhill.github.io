	<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<p> 
			Hi General Assembly! &nbsp;My name is William "Wick" Hill. &nbsp;I live just outside of Boston, and my interest in coding goes back to high school, which is around the time I began programming my <span class="nowrap">TI-83</span> to solve long-form math and science equations.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span><img class="arensteinLaw" src="https://i.imgur.com/9ksc8wB.jpg" alt="sandra and bob"></span>I've worked in several different fields during my life. I worked for a small software company based out of Portland, Oregon called I.S.I. &nbsp;I've always thought it was really cool that they were founded way back in 1988! &nbsp;(I came along much later though, haha.) &nbsp;I also worked as a paralegal for a firm based in NYC that specializes in International Child Custody. &nbsp;My bosses, Bob Arenstein and Sandra Nu√±ez (seen in the image to the right), even won a case before The Hague! &nbsp;Though again, that was before my time. &nbsp;Sandra and Bob taught me a lot, and many of the cases we worked on together were pretty intense, but Bob and Sandra always made sure that we had fun.&nbsp;It was a pretty incredible experience!
			<br>

			<span><img class="grandMarquis" src="https://i.imgur.com/gTGOeHF.jpg" alt="winter in maine"></span>I left Arenstein Law and decided to focus my efforts on music full-time. &nbsp;Music is one of my passions, and it was another industry I'd been a part of from time to time, having worked as an Assistant Engineer <span><img class="zippah" src="https://i.imgur.com/hYJ92nE.jpg" alt="brian and wick in zippah"></span> in various studios. &nbsp;I put into practice what I'd learned from those experiences and built my own recording spaces where I could engineer my albums.  (It's <big>much</big> cheaper that way.) Speaking of cheap: because I needed to live frugally, the studios I built were sometimes in remote locations.  Check out my driveway, my car, and my neighbor's house in the picture in the upper-left! &nbsp;(FYI: Winters in Maine are cold!) &nbsp;When I'd finished tracking an album I'd hop over to a studio where I knew a professional Mixing Engineer, and then voila! &nbsp;Album done. &nbsp;(In the picture to the right I'm peering over the shoulder of the one and only Brian Charles. &nbsp;He's the head engineer over at the very fine Zippah Studios, and I happen to think that he's the best Mixing Engineer in Boston!)
			<br>
			<br>
			<span><img class="rooftop" src="https://i.imgur.com/D4LKYGw.jpg" alt="charlestown rooftop"></span>All in all I've released four full-length albums and an EP, and some of my tunes can be found <a href="https://www.themilligrams.com" target="_blank">here!</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			Now I'm putting music on hold while I pursue coding. &nbsp;I have friends and family who've taken the coding route, and whether they're former-musicians themselves or whether they came to it from another profession there's one thing that unites them all: they all love what they're doing now with coding! 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I've really enjoyed meeting people from General Assembly: everybody's passion for Learning and Collaboration has been very inspiring. &nbsp;And that goes for both teachers and potential students alike! &nbsp;Here's looking forward to speaking further about General Assembly and learning more about the possibilities offered by the world coding. Cheers!
